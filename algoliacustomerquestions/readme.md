Hello George!


This is York Prado, Solutions Engineer at Algolia. I'll be happy to assist you in getting to know more about what records and indexes are to get you started on your search engine journey. Quickly looking at Algolia's FAQ section, I pulled out these definitions for you:

 

> [**What is a record?**](https://www.algolia.com/doc/faq/basics/what-is-a-record/)

> A record is an object you add to an index and want to search for. It can contain any number of attributes.

 

> [**What is an index?**](https://www.algolia.com/doc/faq/basics/what-is-an-index/)

> An index is the place where the data used by a search engine is stored.

 

To make a quick analogy of what these are and how these relate to each other, let's imagine an encyclopedia book about animals. An index is the encyclopedia itself, holding all the information about each individual animal you're interested in. a record would then be each section about an individual animal. This record would contain all the necessary information to learn more about an animal. Things like, what animal kingdom is it from, size, predators, and even anatomy.

 

Lastly, let's go over what type of metrics would be useful for custom ranking. Looking at Algolia's documentation:

 

> [**Custom Ranking**](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/managing-results/must-do/custom-ranking/)

> Custom ranking is a direct and powerful way to adapt Algolia to your business. When you classify records with business metrics such as popularity or rating, your best products appear higher in search results...

> Typical custom ranking attributes include number of sales, views, likes, ratings, release date, etc. Any Boolean or numeric attribute works with custom ranking.

 

To go back to the encyclopedia analogy, let's say you now you put this encyclopedia online and make it searchable (like Wikipedia!). A custom ranking may be the popularity of individual animals and adding that to your record to make a custom ranking. If you assume that most people would search for animals that are furry and cuddly rather than those seen as aggressive and with fangs, you can adjust the popularity index to reflect that. In this case, if you were searching for mammals, a dog would rank higher than a grizzly bear.

 

Let me know if you have any more questions on this. I'd be happy to get on a call to answer more questions or work with you to further relate these examples to your project needs.

 

Have a good day,

 

York Prado

Hello Matt,

 

As part of the Solutions Engineering team, it’s always great hearing back from our customers, whether positive or negative. You’re always free to share your thoughts as we do take constructive feedback seriously and try to help you and all our customers when we can.

 

I hear what you’re saying about the additional clicks per action you now need to perform while deleting and clearing indexes. I just tested this myself and can see that performing this action multiple times can severely slow down your progress. To help you and your team out, I’d love to get on a call and talk about other options we have out of the box to help speed up this process.

 

If you have developers on your team, I do recommend automating your process by using our APIs for [deleting]() https://www.algolia.com/doc/api-reference/api-methods/delete-index/) and [clearing](https://www.algolia.com/doc/api-reference/api-methods/clear-objects/?language=javascript) indexes. We support a number of different languages out of the box and this can help automate away a lot of the iteration slowdowns you may be facing.

 

Feel free to reach out to me if you want to talk further. Always happy to help!

Thank you,

York Prado
